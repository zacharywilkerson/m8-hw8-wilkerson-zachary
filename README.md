# MMC5277: Assignment 8
## Add CSS Transitions and Animations to a Webpage

In this assignment, I used CSS transitions and animations to implement micro interactions on my site. Specifically, I created unique animations and transitions (triggered on hover) for select links and buttons. 

My site for Assignment 8 ([live](https://zacharywilkerson.github.io/m8-hw8-wilkerson-zachary/)) is available through Github Pages. Feel free to have a look (preview below)!
